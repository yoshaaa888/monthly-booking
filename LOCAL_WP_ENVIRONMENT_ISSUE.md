# Local WP Environment Access Issue
## Monthly Booking Plugin Testing Environment

**Issue Date:** August 8, 2025  
**Environment:** t-monthlycampaign.local  
**Status:** ‚ùå Not Accessible

---

## üö® Problem Description

The Local WP environment at `t-monthlycampaign.local` is not accessible from the current testing environment, preventing browser-based verification of Priority 1-4 fixes.

### Error Details:
- **Browser Error:** `net::ERR_SOCKS_CONNECTION_FAILED`
- **Ping Result:** `Temporary failure in name resolution`
- **URL:** `http://t-monthlycampaign.local/wp-admin/`

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Possible Causes:
1. **Local WP Not Running:** Site may not be started in Local WP application
2. **DNS Resolution:** Domain `t-monthlycampaign.local` not configured in hosts file
3. **Network Configuration:** Proxy/firewall blocking local domain access
4. **Environment Isolation:** Testing environment may not have access to local development setup

### Technical Investigation:
```bash
# DNS resolution test
ping t-monthlycampaign.local
# Result: Temporary failure in name resolution

# This confirms the domain is not resolvable from current environment
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Solutions

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Verify Local WP Status:**
   - Open Local WP application
   - Check if `t-monthlycampaign` site shows "Running" status
   - If stopped, click "Start site" button

2. **Check Domain Configuration:**
   - Verify hosts file contains: `127.0.0.1 t-monthlycampaign.local`
   - Windows: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
   - Mac/Linux: `/etc/hosts`

3. **Network Troubleshooting:**
   - Disable firewall temporarily
   - Check for proxy settings blocking local domains
   - Verify no VPN interference

### Alternative Testing Approaches:

#### Option 1: XAMPP/WAMP Setup
```bash
# Install XAMPP with PHP 8.1+
# Create virtual host for t-monthlycampaign.local
# Install WordPress manually
# Upload plugin and test data
```

#### Option 2: Docker Environment
```yaml
# Use docker-compose.yml for WordPress setup
version: '3.8'
services:
  wordpress:
    image: wordpress:php8.1-apache
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: monthly_booking
```

#### Option 3: Remote Testing Environment
- Deploy to staging server
- Use cloud-based WordPress testing platform
- Set up temporary hosting for verification
