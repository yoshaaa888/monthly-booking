# Phase 3 Completion Summary

This report summarizes the features delivered in Phase 3 (PRs #78, #79, #80), recommends next steps for Phase 4 and optimizations, and lists known limitations with suggested follow-ups.

## Delivered in Phase 3

1) 4-1 Campaign List (PR #78, merged)
- Type icons: ％ (percentage) and ¥ (fixed)
- Linked rooms count: Displays number of assigned rooms
- Period types: Fixed / Check-in-relative / Unlimited
- Form polish: i18n labels and UI consistency

2) 4-2 Room List (PR #79, merged)
- Campaign badges: Show active campaigns per room (％/¥ and value)
- Header filters: Status, Campaign presence, Vacancy
- Bulk operations: Assign/Remove campaign to/from selected rooms
- Vacancy status: Uses half-open intervals and 5-day cleaning buffer [checkin, checkout + 5 days)
- Cleaning toggle: Per-room toggle with persistence

3) 4-4 Booking Registration (admin-side initial) (PR #80, merged)
- Recalculate button: “料金再計算” on admin reservation form
- Nonce localization: Proper AJAX localization to avoid 400/403
- Double-discount prevention: When a room-specific percentage campaign already adjusts daily rent, Step 3 subtotal discount is skipped to avoid double-apply; campaign metadata still returned

All PRs passed smoke CI.

## Recommended Next Steps (Phase 4 / Optimization)

A) 4-3 Calendar Management View
- Symbols: Map ◎/○/◆/△/× to availability/campaign/cleaning states with a legend
- Right panel: Show room summary, active campaigns, quick actions (Assign Campaign, Toggle Cleaning)
- Performance: Batch data fetches, paginate/virtualize if many rooms (>100), cache monthly availability, invalidate on CRUD
- Accessibility: Keyboard navigation for grid, aria-live for async updates, described-by tooltips

B) Performance and DB Optimization
- Indexes:
  - Reservations: (room_id), (checkin_date), (checkout_date), composite (room_id, checkin_date, checkout_date)
  - Room-campaign assignments: (room_id), (campaign_id), composite (room_id, start_date, end_date, is_active)
- Caching:
  - Cache per-room availability summaries for the displayed month; invalidate on reservation or assignment changes
- Query batching: Ensure badge/vacancy queries use IN clauses for visible rooms (avoid N+1)

C) UX / i18n / a11y Enhancements
- Complete i18n coverage for newly added labels and tooltips
- Add aria-describedby for badge/tooltips, ensure focus management on modals and bulk action results
- Improve progress/failure granularity for bulk operations with retry affordances

D) Optional Analytics Foundation
- Capture assignment result metrics and campaign effectiveness (applications, average discount rate, estimated ROI)
- Provide simple dashboard cards in the Admin Dashboard for visibility

## Known Limitations and Follow-ups

1) Pricing formula completeness
- Current admin estimate uses minimal necessary logic with campaign integration; full fee/tax/rounding policy varies by plan and may need:
  - Explicit rounding rules (per-day vs total), tax inclusion/exclusion, and plan-specific fees
  - Bedding fee logic standardization if applicable (avoid hardcoded fixed amounts; recommend: bedding_fee = guest_count × daily_rate × stay_days when applicable)
- Follow-up: Lock down official formula per plan (SS/S/M/L), add tests for boundary cases

2) Vacancy display scope
- Current display indicates today’s vacancy/occupied status with cleaning buffer
- “Days until occupied” or “N days free” lookahead not yet displayed
- Follow-up: Optional 30-day lookahead computation, carefully optimized to avoid heavy queries

3) Cleaning tracking simplicity
- Implemented as a simple per-room persisted flag aligned with admin operations
- Follow-up: If integrating with housekeeping workflow, add schema to track last_cleaned_at and job runs, plus role-based ops

4) Bulk operations at scale
- Current batch UX handles progress and per-room errors; very large selections might still be slow
- Follow-up: Add paging-based selection (“Select all filtered”), chunked server processing, and server-side job queues if needed

5) Calendar performance and a11y
- The upcoming 4-3 calendar view will need careful virtualization and semantic navigation
- Follow-up: Plan incremental rollout (list first, then calendar), verify a11y-nightly artifacts

6) Data seeding and environment differences
- Behavior depends on presence of campaign/assignment/reservation data
- Follow-up: Provide seed SQL/commands and a quick-start guide for local admin testing

## Verification Summary

- CI: Smoke workflow passed for #78, #79, #80
- Syntax checks: PHP lints on modified files
- Admin flows: Recalc button wired to existing estimate endpoint with nonce; double-discount prevention guarded

## Suggested Acceptance Criteria for 4-3

- Calendar displays correct symbols for today and month-range including campaigns and cleaning buffers
- Right panel shows summary and enables Assign Campaign and Toggle Cleaning with instant refresh
- Keyboard navigation and screen reader announcements meet baseline a11y requirements
- Performance targets for load and interaction (<1.5s perceived latency for common operations)
